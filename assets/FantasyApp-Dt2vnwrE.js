Fantasy Mobile App</h1><p class="size-l" data-v-fc8b6830>Yahoo! was a pioneer in Fantasy Sports, launching the first free online fantasy product in 1999 and helping bring the game into the mainstream. In 2010, I was selected to lead the design effort to bring Yahoo&#39;s Fantasy Sports platform to iOS, at a time when app design and development were still in their infancy. With few established mobile design patterns, we had to solve complex challenges ourselves. Fantasy Sports, with its heavy statistical data and unique UX requirements, required us to innovate. Once again, we led the way, creating a mobile experience that set the standard for delivering a data-rich, interactive product on mobile devices. As a result of this work, I became one of the forerunners within the company on the topic of mobile design, helping shape future mobile initiatives across Yahoo!.</p><div class="project-summary card" data-v-fc8b6830><div class="project-summary__data padding-2x padding-1x-mobile" data-v-fc8b6830><table data-v-fc8b6830><tbody data-v-fc8b6830><tr data-v-fc8b6830><td class="label" data-v-fc8b6830>Company</td><td class="value" data-v-fc8b6830>Yahoo!</td></tr><tr data-v-fc8b6830><td class="label" data-v-fc8b6830>Year</td><td class="value" data-v-fc8b6830>2010-2015</td></tr><tr data-v-fc8b6830><td class="label" data-v-fc8b6830>Role</td><td class="value" data-v-fc8b6830>Lead UX, UI, Design Manager</td></tr><tr data-v-fc8b6830><td class="label" data-v-fc8b6830>Platform</td><td class="value" data-v-fc8b6830>iOS, Android</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="project-summary__achievements padding-2x padding-1x-mobile" data-v-fc8b6830><ul data-v-fc8b6830><li data-v-fc8b6830>4.5 -&gt; 6M Fantasy Football user growth</li><li data-v-fc8b6830>7M -&gt; 10M user growth across all sports</li><li data-v-fc8b6830>Awarded FSGA Best Mobile Commissioner Product Mobile Implementation 2013, 2014, 2015</li></ul></div></div></section>',1)),a("section",M,[s[0]||(s[0]=a("h3",null,"A Comeback Story",-1)),s[1]||(s[1]=a("p",null,"In 2010, our team took on the task of bringing Yahoo's Fantasy Sports platform to iOS.
