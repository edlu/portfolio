            <h1>Yahoo! Fantasy Mobile App</h1>

            <p class="size-l">Yahoo! was a pioneer in Fantasy Sports, launching the first free online fantasy product in 1999 and helping bring the game into the mainstream. In 2010, I was selected to lead the design effort to bring Yahoo's Fantasy Sports platform to iOS, at a time when app design and development were still in their infancy. With few established mobile design patterns, we had to solve complex challenges ourselves. Fantasy Sports, with its heavy statistical data and unique UX requirements, required us to innovate. Once again, we led the way, creating a mobile experience that set the standard for delivering a data-rich, interactive product on mobile devices. As a result of this work, I became one of the forerunners within the company on the topic of mobile design, helping shape future mobile initiatives across Yahoo!.</p>

            <h3>A Comeback Story</h3>
            
            <p>In 2010, our team took on the task of bringing Yahoo's Fantasy Sports platform to iOS. The team was a group of misfits&mdash;engineers who had some mobile development exerience and no understand sports. Product and design with no experience with mobile technology and patterns. It was a train wreck.  Despite our best efforts, we couldn't deliver the full functionality users expected, launching with a limited feature set. Feedback was swift and brutal—our app was crushed in the iTunes App Store, earning a harsh one-star rating. One review even read, “I'm only giving one star because I can't give 0.”</p>

            <p>We were devastated, embarrassed, and thoroughly humbled. I immediately sought redemption. We scrapped the 2010 version entirely and went back to the drawing board, rebuilding the app from the ground up.</p>

            <p>This time, we took what we had learned and dove deep into user feedback. We spent months iterating on designs, refining the UX, and pushing the boundaries of mobile development to handle the complexities of Fantasy Sports. We faced new challenges, technical hurdles, and pressure to deliver—but we pushed through.</p>

            <p>When the 2011 NFL season came around we launched the new version of the app, and the reception was a complete 180. The app earned a four-star rating from over 97,000 reviews, a testament to the progress we had made. Looking back, that initial failure taught us invaluable lessons about resilience, user-centered design, and the importance of perseverance. It ultimately shaped not only the app but also our approach to mobile projects going forward.</p>

            <p>Over the years the app would evolve with additional features, visual design, and UX enhancements that would shape the industry.  We went on to achieve <em>Best Commissioner Product Mobile Implementation</em> awarded by the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association for three consecutive years from 2013-2015.</p>
