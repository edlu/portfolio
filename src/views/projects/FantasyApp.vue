      <h1>Yahoo! Fantasy Mobile App</h1>
      <p>Yahoo! was a pioneer in Fantasy Sports offering the first free online product in 1999.  They were a key player in bringing Fantasy to the mainstream market.  I was selected to lead design and bring the functionality of the web product to iOS starting with the iPhone.  Each year of enhancements brought additional features and enhancements in visual design.
